#Captain's Log Entry #1 9/19


It's highkey awful.

I would like to make several changes.

Thing is, I was so fixated on making the Javascript work that I completely forgot about styling. 

It's somewhat the same thing that happened with the previous assignment.

Thing's I must learn:

Perfection isn't attainable. 
Sometimes, the best thing to do is to step away from the logic of it all and focus on something else. 

SEGUE

In that way there won't be empty time spaces in which I just look at the code and think how cool it would be if it worked properly.
I will return to this assignment as quickly as possible so that I may make it the way I envisioned it.

Lessons were learned in this assignment. Good ones and bad ones.

Good Lessons: 

Learned of template literals. Pretty neat. 
And that's about it.



Fixes Priority List:

1. Make a timer that resets within each new slide.

2. STYLE...FUCK.

3. Make a better website. That's like a general rule. But this will be priority three. Because reasons. 

4. Better progress management. It is possible. If I feel brain blocked, work on something else where progress CAN be made. 

5. Do my Laundry.

6. Get some sleep. Work is being annoying. Find a way to make work suck less of my time.
